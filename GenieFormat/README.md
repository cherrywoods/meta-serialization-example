# üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (german equivalent: Flaschengeist)
This is another example project for [MetaSerialization[(https://github.com/cherrywoods/swift-meta-serialization).

The genie format is a simple format just consiting of this: üî¶ (You see, it's a modern genie). What you make of it highly depends on you and what you ask the lamps genie. 

This exaple should demonstrate MetaSerializations capabilities for formats that aren't clear without context. 
There is a term for this, I don't know right now. 

Mainly Flaschengeist is about demonstrating the dynamically unwrapping meta tree ability of MetaSerialization.
This gives you a better way to create containers when they are requested.

... A better description will follow...
...The implementation will also follow...
